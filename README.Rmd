# Scraping Data from the Web with R

## Presentation to the Public Health Agency of Canada's R User Group, 2021-09-05

This repo contains the presentation, both the rendered .html and the source .Rmd, as well as an example workbook and a data file of global Circle K locations.

* **The presentation** is in /Rmd/talk_v0.*
* **The workbook** is in /Rmd/examples/example_1_foodland.Rmd

**Note** that in order to knit the presentation Rmd, you need a mapbox API key to make the heat map. You can get one for free at mapbox's website, or just comment out that code chunk.
